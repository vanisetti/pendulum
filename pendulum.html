		<div class="section-detail">
			I used a classic control Pendulum environment to begin with but came across troubles with the code as it was too complicated. Hence I used someone else's code on Git Hub which was called the "Weighted Cross Entropy method for inverted pendulum." It was much simpler to work with.

		<div class="section-title">Goal</div>
		<div class="section-detail">

			 At first, I knew I wanted to work in an environment where there was no threshold for success. And the Pendulum didn't have that, there was no limit for the high score. Ms.Pries helped me come up witht he idea to change the parameters in the code to see how it affected the scores.We chose to alter the value of alpha and observe the changes in the scores. Previously, we worked on altering the value of alpha for our kickstarted project so it seemed like a good place to start.

		<div class="section-detail">
			I began changing the values of alpha but the scores printed had no structure. There was no way to compare data so I used csv writer to rganize the data. I had three values categorized: alpha, episode number and score. using the tables obtained using csv it was easier to distinguish the data and notice the changes or trends.

		<div class="section-detail">
			Because of a shortage of time, I was only able to experiment with alpha. There was another code whcih included more advanced factors including 'noise' and in the future I'd like to dive deeper into that.
